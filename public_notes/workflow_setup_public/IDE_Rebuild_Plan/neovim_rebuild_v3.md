# Keep Note Parsing

- [ ] Task -> 🗒️ validate this "if you want to seach a regular expression us `/\v` if you want to use verbatim use `/\V` else escape Characters"
- [ ] Task -> 🗒️ find the equivalent of `ctrl+f` on EX commands for search command
- [ ] Task -> 🗒️ consider shortening `z=1` you use this a lot

## Search Commands

- [ ] Task -> 🗒️ prepopualte a literal search `/\V`
- [ ] Task -> 🗒️ prepopualte a regex search `/\v` with some examples `/\vRead|Task`

- [ ] Task -> 🗒️ map a copy results command. Use the defualt yank register https://keep.google.com/u/0/#NOTE/1C_d8ux-dxf39sklvu-Nge2fvwgeo09iL2VuZBiwPpIMpkhK3hzVIdqNuEnHrCrROA8t6JhJh

## Dot Operator

> Focus more on `.` efficiency

## Normal Command

> combine with range more often

- [ ] Habit -> 🏃 combine normal command with the `.` operator
- [ ] Habit -> 🏃 combine with the `@macro`
- [ ] Task -> 🗒️ test some combine normal command with the `.` operator test patterns out
- [ ] Task -> 🗒️ test some combine normal command with the `.` operator + visual Selection patterns out

> `%norm LINWISE ACTION` will apply to whole file linewise
> Example `%norm i //`

## Habits

- [ ] Task -> 🗒️ test out `d{motion}` with Search
  - Maybe `dap` or `di{` inside source code?
  - Maybe `*` + `dw` + `.`

- [ ] Habit -> 🏃 delete rather than append if change is small and you want `.` repetation (high mental overhead)
- [ ] Habit -> 🏃 need to internalize range selection `%` full file and `'<,>'` visual selection
