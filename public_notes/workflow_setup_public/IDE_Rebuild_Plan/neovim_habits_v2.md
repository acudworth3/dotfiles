# Neovim Habits

> not strictly tasks to complete

- [ ] Task -> 🗒️ consider renaming this to include all cli activity

## CLI

- [ ] Task -> 🗒️ replace use of grep with rg

## small

- [ ] Habit -> 🏃 use `o` to move to front and back of visual selection. Use this when you've typed `vip` but didn't end up exactly selecting what you need.
- [ ] Habit -> 🏃 use `CTLR+h` instead of `backspace` insert mode --> (Also works in standard bash shell)
- [ ] Habit -> 🏃 use `ga` + letter for case conversion
- [ ] Habit -> 🏃 practice `P` which is left left vs `p` which is right paste when pasting
- [ ] Habit -> 🏃 use `leader + fr + :` for last ex command --> populate something and reuse it here

## medium

- [ ] Habit -> 🏃 in command mode `:` hit `ctrl+f` to write commands in a buffer. `<Enter>` to run them. Combine with `!!` for fast shell commands

- [ ] Task -> 🗒️ figure out how to paste above and below a line - depends on `\n` character in copied value --> See linewise vs characterwise note
- [ ] Habit -> 🏃 adopt change then repeat via `.` Pattern
- [ ] Habit -> 🏃 Use `//<ENTER>` to resume last search. Combine with `*` first.

- [ ] Habit -> 🏃 Tree based navigating in editor `leader + f + s` works pretty well
- [ ] Task -> 🗒️ cyclical review of fundamentals (reread Practical VIM By Drew Niel)
- [ ] Habit -> 🏃 Begin using grep-able tags example `nvim-ref` and build a system around this
- [ ] Task -> 🗒️ use `mm` regularly (inside a file) and `learder + M + mark` to return

- [ ] Habit -> 🏃 multi-cursor based find and replace

## Hard

### Add to Hard Time Plugin

- [ ] Task -> 🗒️ disable `w` or `b` >=5

### Advanced Navigation

- [ ] Habit -> 🏃 `gv` last visual selection
- [ ] Learn -> ❔ learn to navigate the change list `g;` and `g,`

### Registers + Macros

- [ ] Task -> 🗒️ do a fundamentals practice of recorind a macro then editing it

### Norm Command

> Build habits and knowledge around the `vip:norm TEXT` pattern

- [ ] Learn -> ❔ learn to use `<esc>` and other non alpha characters when doing a norm command

## Lua Development

> Add this to the toolkit

- [ ] Task -> 🗒️ write some telescope actions/pickers
- [ ] Task -> 🗒️ lua development environment
- [ ] learn -> ❔ learn basics of the lua nvim api

## LSP Review

- [ ] Task -> 🗒️ [lsp doc](../IDE_Rebuild_References/nvim_ref_LSP_Info.md)

## build_strategy v2

- [ ] learn -> ❔ ctrl keys for insert mode
- [ ] learn -> ❔ register use cases - MACROs and scripting
  - [ ] Task -> 🗒️ ~use `norm@ALPHA` on a visual selection to run a single line macro on each~
- [ ] learn -> ❔ edit via find using :g/<pattern>/ norm gets most complicated editing tasks done

- [ ] learn -> ❔ review discoverability by types (telescope + ctrl+d etc)
- [ ] task -> 🗒️ replace vimscript in config with lua

- [ ] parse -> 📚 https://github.com/charlax/professional-programming?tab=readme-ov-file#vim
