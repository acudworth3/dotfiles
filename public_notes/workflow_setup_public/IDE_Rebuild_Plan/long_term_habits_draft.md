> Plan is to be intentional with which tool is used for which activity. attempt consistent keybindings across systems

- [x] learn -> ❔ implement vim motions in vscode
- [x] learn -> ❔ implement vim motions in visual studio

### Activity API Testing: Postman

## Activity - UNDER REVIEW

> Need to review tool choices

### Random Data Generation

> Gold standard is vscode random extension with multicursor

### Database Management: dbeaver

- Database Activity: dbeaver (Defautl) Azure Data Studio (Backup)
  - [ ] Task -> 🗒️ review other db clients
  - [ ] Task -> 🗒️ look for vim keybindings

### API Testing: Postman

## Visual Studio

> Avoid this

- [ ] Task -> 🗒️ find an easy motion plugin (Easy Peasy)
- [x] Task -> 🗒️ Implement on work computer
- [ ] Task -> 🗒️ Implement on personal computer

## Visual Studio Code

- [x] Task -> 🗒️ Implement on work computer
- [x] Task -> 🗒️ Implement on personal computer
- [x] Task -> 🗒️ figure out `CTRL+D/U`
- [x] Apply Default: Relative Line Number
