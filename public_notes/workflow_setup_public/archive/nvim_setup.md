## Commands to Learn

> Important usage of `:` operator

- :wq --> write and close in one step
- CTRL+z "then" fg --> Put vim in the background then return to it

- [x] Learn -> ‚ùî :args + :argsdo learn more about this
  - `:argdo %s/\<x_cnt\>/x_counter/ge | update`
  - udpate saves file if modified (I think this is vimscript)
  - :args \*.md appears to load all cwd results into buffers

### Commands to Learn -- File content to CLI (SUBSET)

## Key Strokes

> These are working lists that I will add and remove to as things become 2nd nature

### Key Strokes - Learn - View Manipulation

> generally this is achieved via plugins + distributions

- [ ] Learn -> ‚ùî alias things in command mode `wrap and no-wrap` (maybe favor command complete)
- [ ] Task -> ‚óΩ remap end of line to something else (not $)
- [ ] Task -> ‚óΩ consider ALT+ENTER for full screen mode and reset wezterm

- [ ] Habit -> üèÉ Begin using nvim windows not wt tabs (Not sure if htis it a good idea)
- [x] Habit -> üèÉ Fast change colorscheme :Telescope colorscheme
- [x] Learn -> ‚ùî Session manipulation (likely via plugin)

### View Manipulation (Folds)

- [ ] Learn -> ‚ùî Fold Manipulation (z + OTHER KEYS)
- [ ] Learn -> ‚ùî Figure out LSP Based automation
- [ ] Task -> ‚óΩ Setup a deeply nested object and do a folder per section exercise
- [ ] Task -> ‚óΩ Consider ":set foldclose=all"
- [ ] Task -> ‚óΩ Consider "set foldmethod=indent"

### Key Strokes - Learn - View Tabs

> The advantage of tabs is organizing windows. No point in useing tabs over buffers

- :tab --> open current file in tab (find hotkey)
- \ t "on file" --> open file in tab from neo tree
- gt --> move between tabs

- [x] Learn -> ‚ùî how to open in tab from find file

### Key Strokes - Don't Do

### Key Strokes - Learn - General

- [x] Habit -> üèÉ Try to stay in normal mode
  - [x] Habit -> üèÉ favor 'x' for deletion
  - [ ] Habit -> üèÉ favor 'r' and 'R' for single line writes
    - [ ] Task -> ‚óΩ ~chain with 'd+$' to delete line + start typing~ c and C (change) do this
- [ ] Learn -> ‚ùî window management https://github.com/folke/edgy.nvim
- [ ] Learn -> ‚ùî Insert mode hotkey map (CTRL+w, CTRL+D, CTRL+T)

### Key Strokes - Learn - Clipboard Basics

> y and yy are putting things into the clipboard

- :edit FILENAME allows 'p' to paste in FILENAME

### Key Strokes - Mappings to Setup

- "Surround with {}" :map <F5> i{<Esc>ea}<Esc>

### Key Strokes - Reference - Line Manipulation

- > > "use as tab in normal mode"

#### Key Strokes - Blank Lines

- [ ] Learn -> ‚ùîhow to insert a blank line in normal mode

- O --> "Add blank line above"
- o --> "Add blank line above"
- J --> "Combine 2 lines" + "delete an empty line"

#### Key Strokes - Deleting Lines

##### Normal Mode

- D --> "delete to end of line; alternative to d$"
- S --> "S delete line and go into insert mode"
- C --> "change to end of line - delete rest of line and go into insert mode"

- yy p --> "duplicate line"
- d$ --> "delete to end of line"
- d$a --> "delete to end of line and begin editing"
- d0 --> "delete to start of line"

##### Insert Mode

- CTRL+U --> "delete whole line"
- CTRL+O --> "run a normal mode command and return to insert mode. example CTRL+O dd"

#### Key Strokes - Multi Line Edits

> visual block follwoed by edits then esc. This si close to multi cursor. Edits
> will be applied to each line selected

### Key Strokes - Reference - Character Manipulation

- ~~ea --> "e 'end' puts you at the end of the word"
  --> "a 'append' puts you in insert mode"~~

- A --> Puts you at the end of the line in append mode
- R --> "REPLACE Begin Overwriting the text where you are"

> "e puts you at the end of the next word w puts you at the start
> of the next word useful when combined with i (insert), a (append), R (replace)"

### Key Strokes - Reference - Common Commands

> For permanent setting modify init.lua
> To do it without reloading run the following

> Autocompletion
> "rely on CTRL+P" while in insert mode

- [ ] Read -> üìñ read "Completing Specific Items"
- g CTRL+G --> summarize line words etc in the file (CTRL+G applied to selection)

### Key Strokes - Reference - Navigation - Across files

- 'gf' will take you straight to a file definition
- figure out how to read in the current file more easily

### Key Strokes - Reference - Navigation

-- This will expand snippets if the LSP sent a snippet.~~u

- end of line --> $ + alternate use END
- start of line --> 0 alternate use HOME

- use fx/Tx to jump to character x in a line
  - combine with ; or , to nav mutiples

## Placeholder

> windo does things to all windows

- example `windo w` "Window do"saves all windows
  Also see |:tabdo|, |:argdo|, |:windo|, |:cdo|, |:ldo|, |:cfdo| and |:lfdo|.

- :wall will save all files

> Put things here that are interesting, but not well
> Categorized yet

`vim -o file1 file2 file3` open 3 files split horizontally

- Splitting Windows + open file in 1 command
  These command modifiers can be combined to make a vertically split window
  occupy the full height. Example: >
  :vertical topleft split tags
  Opens a vertically split, full-height window on the "tags" file at the far
  left of the Vim window.
